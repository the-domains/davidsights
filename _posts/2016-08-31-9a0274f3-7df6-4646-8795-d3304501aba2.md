# Perspective

During my walk home today, I remembered how alien downtown Chicago used to feel. Even though I had been downtown plenty of times, something about the huge buildings, fancy parks, and nice jobs felt so big. Downtown Chicago felt huge. Now I've got a nice job, and I'm living downtown. It really feels like home now. And it's weird that any of it ever felt so big to me. But it's also weird that it doesn't feel so big anymore.
